# CLI Word Guess Game

This game utilizes node and the command line to challenge the player to guess words from a pre-set list.  Screenshots included in the "screenshots" folder of this repository.

## Gameplay

To play the game, make sure you clone the repository and use npm to install inquirer (you can just enter the directory you cloned the repository to and type "npm install" or install inquirer specifically using "npm install inquirer").

Enter the directory of the cloned repository and type "node index" to play.  Follow the on-screen prompts.

## Future Development

To expand upon this game in the future I would utilize an API to find words and categories to use on-demand for the user to utilize.
